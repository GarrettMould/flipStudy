# FlipStudy

**FlipStudy** is an interactive learning prototype that syncs educational videos with AP-style practice questions.

Inspired by a UI pattern on OpenAI’s website, FlipStudy was designed to make passive video learning active and engaging. While watching a video (e.g. a short AP Economics explanation), learners interact with key takeaways through "flipcards" — cards that show a core concept on the front, and an AP-style question on the back.

This project was originally built as part of my work on [AP Dojo](https://apdojo.com), and is now being developed into a standalone tool.

## ✨ Features (v1.0)

- Vertically stacked flipcards beneath the video
- Each flipcard includes:
